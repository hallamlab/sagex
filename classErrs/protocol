Since classification errors are largely functions of -k -p -a, cross validation will need to happen at many test points. For each cross validation, take the following steps.

Ecoli cross-validation:
1. Use sequence.cpp to generate a training and testing fasta. ARg: ./sequence ./../../../mg1655eColi.fasta 4000 1000 1> train 2> test
2. Append the testing data to the metagenome fasta.
3. Make a blastn db from the cat'd file.
4. Run blastn to produce a blast table for use in alignment filtering.
5. Run the pipeline using the training data as the SAG & the cat'd file as the metagenome.
6. Count classification errors in R using seqinr
